**By:** Ryan Chapin [Contact Info](http://www.ryanchapin.com/contact.html)

This purpose of this project is to provide a simple, known set of MapReduce algorithms that can be used for integration testing the [Apache MRUnit project](https://mrunit.apache.org/).

## Development Environment Set-up

This project was developed with Eclipse Mars, but can be compiled from the command line with maven.

The pom specifies _Java 1.8_.

### To set up to develop, test, and run from within Eclipse

#### Requires the following Eclipse plugins:

   * m2e
   * m2e slf4j
   * m2e build-helper-maven-plugin

#### To set up in Eclipse:

1. From within Eclipse, go to _File -> Import_ and select, _Maven -> Existing Maven Projects_ and click _Next_.
2. Then browse to the /mrunit-test-harness dir and select it.

## TODOs

This is more or less a sketch of a project at this point and I have not had a chance to flesh out the full list of things to be added . . . .
